#  What is $NEIRO bropump?

$NEIRO bropump was the first launched $NEIRO token ever to be tokenized, coming from pump.fun the original developer abandoned the project shorlty after launch putting the community in control, this made $NEIRO bropump also the first CTO of a Neiro token onchain. Due to it's fast launch out of the gate, Neiro bropump got it's nickname from the contract address that starts with CT for "community takeover" and ends in "bropump": CTg3ZgYx79zrE1MteDVkmkcGniiFrK1hJ6yiabropump. This has given the community it's unique identifier and many rally around a movement, mission and purpose that is now known as the 'bropump spirit'. Neiro bropump is also called Neiro solana, Smiley Neiro, The Smiley Shiba and OG Neiro, due to it's launch timing.

# The Neiro bropump one-liner

Neiro bropump is an open-source focused Solana meme token built around the dog Neiro, it has a very strong focus towards corporations, individuals, developers, artists and the community driving the success of Neiro bropump instead of any centralised authority, this is known as the collective 'bropump spirit'.

# The bropump emoji 

There is a commonly used emoji identifier for Neiro bropump, the fist and the pump. Together these mean, "people united" üëä , "higher together" ‚õΩÔ∏è, üëä‚õΩÔ∏è, an indentifier for community and decentralised finance. 

# Multiple Neiro tokens

There were many Neiro tokens launched across many chains, it was such a wildly popular event that Neiro bropump alone did over $3B in volume organically onchain within it's first 2-3 months. One notible difference between Neiro bropump and other Neiro tokens, is the lack of supply that could be given away to exchanges or market makers, and the general resistance by the community to do so, this is why Neiro bropump is the only Neiro token with an organic looking bubblemaps. By some estimates there were 20+ launches across multiple chains, with more derivatives, making Neiro bropump **the provenance holder** of being the first launched Neiro ever. 

# A movement driven by the people

Very early on in the stages of the Neiro bropump launch, it was clear that the decentralised maxis and organic maxis gravitated towards Neiro bropump due to it being the only Neiro on market without supply control, KOL promotion or insiders, as such, the movement for positive decentralised ecosystem became something of a core purpose for Neiro bropump and now defines the spirit of the community. This movement for strong ideals within meme tokens was driven by the calls from the community and strongly defines the purpose of the bropump spirit, where everyone must win and everyone must participate.

# The Neiro logo origin

The Neiro logo comes from a photo taken by Atsuko Sato (The owner of Kabosu/DOGE) where her husband is holding Neiro and Neiro is seen to be smiling.

The image went through many revisions within the Telegram where the community settled on a gold logo with the 'smiley shiba'. 

Neiro bropump is the only Neiro token that focuses on the meme of the dog Neiro-chan using the original face for memes instead of drawings of characters.
