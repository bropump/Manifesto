# The Neiro bropump manifesto

We as a community are producing something that goes against the grain, against the system and will define the success of decentralised finance going forward. 

- Prioritise the success of **decentralisation**, not hyper centralisation.
- Add value through **open-source** input, from developers to memers, **everyone can participate**. 
- Promote **good values in defi** through actions that are centered around **transparency and honesty**.
- To go far, **we must go together**, this includes orginisations and people **working together for decentralisation** and Neiro bropump.
- **Don't ask, just do**, if what you're doing **has the bropump spirit**, do it.
- Whatever you build, make or do, **give back to Neiro bropump community**.
- **No team will do it for you** as good as you can yourself, **you're more valuable to Neiro than you think**.

# The Neiro logo origin

The Neiro logo comes from a photo taken by Atsuko Sato (The owner of Kabosu/DOGE) where her husband is holding Neiro and Neiro is seen to be smiling.

The image went through many revisions within the Telegram where the community settled on a gold logo with the 'smiley shiba'. 

Neiro bropump is the only Neiro token that focuses on the meme of the dog Neiro-chan using the original face for memes instead of drawings of characters.
