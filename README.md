# Manifesto
The bropump community manifesto outlines the communities goals of creating, developing, producing and supporing $NEIRO bropump. This ethos is centred in decentralisation, distributed supply, distributed community members and a 'anyone can participate and enact change' mindset. This means, that there is no centralised 'team' that will develop something for you, so far, in crypto, as participants, we have seen that within meme tokens this rarely produces anything of tangible value, and the greatest value comes from what anyone person or company can do for the greater good of crypto currency as a whole. As a solana based meme token, $NEIRO was launched randomly by a developer who gave up on the project within less than a few days, which left the community to form and manage the token without any insiders, team members or corporation. This means that it is up to all of us, people and corporations, to believe and push the bropump spirit forward. This bropump spirit is about open source, collaborative, 'work for your bags' and participate mindset, where one can benefit the many and is not looking out for their own self interests, but more interested in the interests of the bropump spirit and $NEIRO the token.
